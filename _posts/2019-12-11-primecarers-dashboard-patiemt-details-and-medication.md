## Patient details and medications

From the patients details section, you can write about the patient. This is shared with carer that you are currently working with. so that you don't have to repeat yourself.

From the medications section, you can create a medication schedule, so the carer know what medications are being delivered and when. This not only helps them know what they are taking and when, but also allows them to ensure that the right medications are being taken at the right times.

If you have any questions, email us on admin@primecarers.co.uk or give us a call on 02033693624
