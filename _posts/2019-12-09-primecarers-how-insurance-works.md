## How insurance works on PrimeCarers

All visits booked over the platform are covered by our insurance. This is provided to us by a specialist carer insurance company, Fish, which covers you if anything happens to the carer or the person being looked after. Click here to see the details of that insurance.

If you have any questions, email us on admin@primecarers.co.uk or give us a call on 02033693624
