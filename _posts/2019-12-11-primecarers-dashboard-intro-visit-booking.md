## How to book an introductory visit

Booking introductory visits, at a time and date agreed with your carers, allows you to meet them and, together, find out whether the relationship will work for you, your family and the carer. To book an introductory visit:

Hit the book visit button
 - Go to Chat
 - Enter your payment details, if you haven't already - Intro visits are free, however for carer safety we do require that you enter payment details before they visit you. No payment will be taken
 - Select your carer, and the time and date you both agree on for your introductory visit
 - Select the times and dates required
 - Review your order
 - Confirm and book you visit
