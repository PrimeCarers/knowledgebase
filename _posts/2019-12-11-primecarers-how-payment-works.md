## How payments work on PrimeCarers

Payment is taken 24-48hrs after the end of your visit. This is designed to give you time to prevent the payment from occurring by getting in-touch with the team

## How do you pay for care?
You can use either your Debit or Credit card to pay directly through our platform. When you book a first visit you will be asked to enter your card details and these will be saved securely for future visits by Stripe.

We have chosen Stripe as our secure, encrypted, PCI compliant and easy to use payment solution. All payments are handled through Stripe on the PrimeCarers platform and can be made using a Debit or Credit Card. Stripe will process your personal financial data through their secure and encrypted service. PrimeCarers does not see this sensitive data. Payment goes directly to the carers, minus PrimeCarers commission.

## What is Stripe?
Stripe is the secure payment platform that we use to handle payments on PrimeCarers. They are used by over 10,000 companies including Oxfam, British Heart Foundation and Unicef so you can be sure that your details are in safe hands. You can learn more at Stripe. Stripe requires your card details to be entered when booking your first visit but your first visit is still free and only an introductory visit.

## Why do we take payment details before the intro visit?
We ask for your payment details before you book your free introductory visit but you will not be charged â€“ this is simply so we have a validated reference of who requested the visit and is an important part of our safeguarding policy.
