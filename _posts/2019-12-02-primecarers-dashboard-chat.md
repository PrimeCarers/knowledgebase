## How to chat with carers

Chatting you your carer is the first thing you will want do on the platform. Getting to know them, and whether they will be someone you want to work with is incredibly important. It is also important to understand whether or not they can do the job and are available to do it.
When you first get in touch:
 - Let them know what you need
 - Let them know what times you need it (remember to indicate whether those times are flexible)
 - Ask them if they are comfortable with what has been described

 Arrange an introductory visit
 - Suggest a couple of times for you to meet where the care will be delivered
 - Agree on a time and date
 - Hit "Book intro visit" to book the interview and select the time and date agreed
